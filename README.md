Singularity Wars
================

“Singularity Wars” is an arcade game proof-of-concept, inspired by “Geometry Wars”, a Xbox Live Arcade game.
It was developed with the open-source Cocos2D game framework, for the Mobile Applications Development, at ISCTE-IUL.
The player has to shoot down enemies, while avoid colliding with them.

It features retina graphics, @ 60fps (until you start shooting lasers).

It also supports notifications.

Bug fixes and suggestions are welcome!
